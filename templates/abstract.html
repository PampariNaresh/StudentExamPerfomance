        In the modern educational landscape, understanding and predicting students' exam performance has become crucial
        for
        educators and institutions. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict students' exam
        scores
        based on a comprehensive set of parameters, including reading, writing, and listening scores, group dynamics,
        race, and
        parental education levels. By utilizing various machine learning models and selecting the best-performing one,
        this
        study seeks to contribute to the advancement of educational analytics and provide insights into the factors that
        influence students' academic outcomes.
        Through statistical techniques and data visualization, this project seeks to identify trends, patterns, and
        factors that
        influence student performance. The results contribute valuable insights for educators, administrators, and
        policymakers
        to design targeted interventions, personalized learning strategies, and curriculum improvements.
        The existing project on student exam performance analysis typically involves a retrospective examination of
        historical
        academic data to identify trends and patterns in students' performance. It might use basic statistical methods
        to
        calculate averages, standard deviations, and correlations among variables. This approach offers a retrospective
        view of
        student outcomes and provides limited insights into the factors influencing performance.
        The proposed project significantly advances the existing approach by incorporating predictive analytics and a
        comprehensive set of parameters, including reading score, listening score, test preparation, lunch time, race,
        and
        potentially group information. Rather than just examining historical data, the proposed project uses machine
        learning
        algorithms like Decision Tree ,gradient boosting ,Linear regression and decision the best model that gives the
        accurate
        score of the student in the exam and statistical models to predict students' future exam performance based on
        these
        parameters.
